            <h2> Responsive story telling Propalsal</h2>
            <p>
                Due to the deep influence of 80s sci-fi films and bitmap video games, the responsive story telling will be made of Arnold's interpretation of the retrofuturistic aesthestics. It won't make any sense, and that's the whole point. It will be try to throw you off what you expect from this site. As soon as you feel that feeling, it gives you the works page. I want to take control over the users' sense.
