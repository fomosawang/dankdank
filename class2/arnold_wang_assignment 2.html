            I believe this personal website will be a portfolio showcase. With that said, the audiance will naturally be EVERYONE who enter the site voluntarily or not. Or I can also see that statement as PEOPLE WHOM I WANT TO ATTRACT. The presented works will most likely be objects and graphic works. While I have only few graphic works that will be presented, I can still showcase the graphic skill in website design. Building a website that ties different projects that I have done. In order to do that the site must basically represent my character as creator and through interaction narrate those project in my voice. "The About Page" will be the most important part in terms of projecting myself as an artist while able to present the personal information clear and seen. I hope &#40;the lack of skill I have now&#41; to make the users to literally interact with my piece before they see the project. For example, the switch needs to be turned on the advance to the project that is a lighting product. The site will have graphic elements that also ties all actions into its identity.
